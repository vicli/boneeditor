/**
 * An Edit is a datatype that makes it easier to make sure
 * that everything is threadsafe. It has a value which is 
 * the string that it represents. It also has an owner which
 * is either the client that originally created it or is the
 * document itself. When any document, regardless of the
 * document's name, owns an edit, that edit is owned by 
 * "document", not by the document's name. This is secure 
 * because no client can have a name longer than six letters
 * as enforced in the GUI, and "document" is more than six
 * letters long.
 *
 * Testing strategy -- This will be tested like most simple 
 * objects. There will be an EditTest class which will create
 * edits, use the provided methods on those edits, and assert
 * that those methods worked correctly.
